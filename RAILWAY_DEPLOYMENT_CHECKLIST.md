## 🔍 **Expected Results**

### **Home Page** (`/`)
```json
{
  "message": "Trading Alert Bot Service",
  "status": "running",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/health",
    "home": "/",
    "status": "/status"
  }
}
```

### **Health Check** (`/health`)
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "bot_running": true,
  "uptime": "00:05:30",
  "total_signals": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T01:49:35.299342"
}
```

### **Status Page** (`/status`)
```json
{
  "bot_status": "running",
  "uptime": "00:00:14",
  "total_signals": 0,
  "errors_count": 0,
  "start_time": "2025-08-16T01:49:27.170747",
  "current_time": "2025-08-16T01:49:41.764041"
}
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Build Fails**
- [ ] Check that `requirements.txt` is in root directory
- [ ] Verify `Procfile` format is correct
- [ ] Ensure Python version compatibility

### **Bot Won't Start**
- [ ] Check environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Verify Telegram bot token and chat ID
- [ ] Check deployment logs for specific errors

### **Endpoints Not Working**
- [ ] Wait 1-2 minutes for full deployment
- [ ] Check if service is running in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Verify the generated URL is correct

## 📊 **Monitoring**

### **Railway Dashboard**
- [ ] Check deployment status (should be green)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] View real-time logs
- [ ] Track deployment history

### **Health Monitoring**
- [ ] Test health endpoint every hour initially
- [ ] Monitor for any error responses
- [ ] Check uptime and performance

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Railway shows "Deployed" status
- [ ] All endpoints return 200 OK responses
- [ ] Health check shows "healthy" status
- [ ] Service is accessible via the generated URL
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Deployment**
